### Project Name: Analyze NYSE Data
#### Project Description: 
In this project I analyzed real life data from the New York Stock Exchange  provided by Kaggle. In this project, I have gone through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing an inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. The goal of the project is to perform an analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.

#### Background:
I used the Fundamentals.csv and Securities.csv files provided by Kaggle. The Fundamentals file provides the fundamental financial data gathered from SEC 10K annual filings from 448 companies listed on the S&P 500 index. The Securities file provided the industry or sector information the companies are categorized under on the S&P 500 index.

#### Project Goal:
* interpret the measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range)
* use a combination of Excel or Google Sheets functions (e.g., IF statements, INDEX and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, drop downs, data validation, VLOOKUP).
* analyze and forecast financial business metrics using Excel or Google Sheets.
* create visualizations of a business metric and use Excel or Google Sheets to create a financial forecast model.
